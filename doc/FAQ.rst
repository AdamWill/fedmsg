Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

- Is there a list of all messages?

  - Yes!  See :doc:`topics`.

- When will we be getting koji messages?

  - We have them now (we got them in late January, 2013)!  Look for
    ``org.fedoraproject.prod.buildsys...``

- When will we be getting bugzilla messages?

  - Not for a while, unfortunately.  We're waiting on Red Hat to sort out issues
    on their end with qpidd.

- Can I deploy fedmsg at my site, even if it has nothing to do with Fedora?

  - Yes.  It was designed so that all the Fedora-isms could be separated out
    into plugins.  Get in touch with ``#fedora-apps`` or create a ticket if
    you'd like to try this out.
